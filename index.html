Privacy Policy for Status Saver

Effective Date: November 27, 2025

This Privacy Policy informs you regarding the policies of Status Saver (referred to as "the App" or "We") regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our Status Saver mobile application.

Our Commitment to Your Privacy:
We respect your privacy. Your statuses are not uploaded, transmitted, or shared with us or any third parties. This App is designed solely to save media content (images and videos) locally on your device. We do not require or collect any personally identifiable information from you.

1. Information Collection and Use (Zero Data Collection)

The Status Saver App operates entirely offline and locally with respect to the content it manages.

Personal Data

We do not collect, store, or transmit any Personal Data or Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as your name, email address, phone number, location, or unique identifiers.

Status Content

What we do: The App accesses media (images and videos) that are temporarily stored by the WhatsApp application on your device in the .Statuses directory.

What we don't do: This content is processed, viewed, and saved only within your device's local storage. We do not transmit, upload, or share this status media content outside of your device.

2. Permissions and Data Access

The App requires specific permissions to function. We only request permissions necessary for local operation.

Storage Access (Mandatory)

The App utilizes the Android Storage Access Framework (SAF) to gain permission from you to access the specific directory containing the status files (Android/media/com.whatsapp/WhatsApp/Media/.Statuses).

Purpose: This permission is strictly used to read the temporary status files and to write (save) the selected files to a general public media folder (like Pictures/Movies) on your device, giving you permanent access to the content.

No Broader Access: We do not scan, read, or upload files from any other folder on your device.

3. Log Data

The Status Saver App relies on standard third-party services (such as Google Play Services) that may collect data and information (called "Log Data") in the event of an error or crash.

This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. This information is used solely for diagnosing and improving application stability and performance.

4. Third-Party Service Providers and Advertising

We use third-party service providers to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, and to perform Service-related functions, including advertising.

Google AdMob / AdSense

We use Google AdMob to display advertisements within the App. Google is one of the third-party vendors, and it uses cookies, device identifiers, and other information to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to the App or other websites.

The data collected by Google for advertising purposes may include:

Online Identifiers: Device identifier, IP address, and advertising identifiers (e.g., Google Advertiser ID).

Usage Data: Information about how you interact with the App and the advertisements shown.

Location: Approximate location data derived from the IP address.

This data is used by Google to provide, improve, and measure personalized advertising services. You can generally opt out of personalized advertising by visiting your device settings or through Google's Ad settings.

5. Security

We value your trust in providing us access to local files, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your data (by not collecting it). However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

6. Links to Other Sites

The App is designed to interact with WhatsApp for status viewing. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with WhatsApp or Meta Platforms, Inc. This policy applies only to our Status Saver App.

7. Children's Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take necessary actions.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
